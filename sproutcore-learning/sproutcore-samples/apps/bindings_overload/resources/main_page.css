/**
  Custom styling can be done in your CSS files.

  Any CSS files in the resources directory will automatically be included--you
  don't need to explicitly require them as you traditionally do in HTML.

  Note that the class names of views correspond to their JavaScript class. For
  example, SC.ButtonView becomes sc-button-view, SC.TextFieldView becomes
  sc-text-field-view, etc. Sub-classes will inherit their parents' class
  names, as well, so applying styles to '.sc-view' would affect ButtonViews
  and TextFieldViews both.

  You can define a custom class name by setting the classNames property on
  your view. See our custom view in main_page.js, which we style below by
  using the '.bindings-controls' selector.
