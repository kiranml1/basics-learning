/** @class

  This controller is responsible for the functioning of the entire app. It
  does a few things:

   1. It holds the properties to which the views are bound.
   2. It contains the method that is fired by the timer (which is itself setup
      in BindingsOverload.main in main.js).
   3. It contains and manages the pool of buttons. We recycle buttons so that
      we don't gobble up the browser's memory.

  Note that traditionally, controllers are named starting with a lower-case
  letter (BindingsOverload.appController vs BindingsOverload.AppController),
  because controllers represent a single instance, not a class.

BindingsOverload.appController = SC.Object.create({
  /**
    The title of the buttons. This is modified when you edit the
    TextFieldView.

  /**
    The enabled state of the buttons. This is modified when you click the
    checkbox.

  isEnabled: YES,

  /**
    The button pool is an array of FlyingButtonViews.

    When a button is done with its display cycle, it calls returnToPool(),
    which pushes the view onto the array.

    Later, when the timer fires, it gets the next available FlyingButtonView
    from the pool, updates its coordinates, and appends it back to the main
    pane.

    Note that this property begins with an underscore. We name it with an
    underscore to imply that it is a private property, and that external
    classes shouldn't access it. That's why we expose a public method
    (returnToPool) to return views to the pool, instead of having them push to
    the array themselves.

    First, it checks to see if any buttons are available in the button pool.

    then appends it to the main pane.

    If not, it creates a new button and adds it to the pane.
