			You cannot accomplish this with the current code. A wrapper div around the bottom three columns solves the problem. So you think, no big deal, just insert a div. That breaks the grid since Grid 960 relies on parents and children to apply the styles (remember the selector container_12 .grid_4?) A subgrid solves the problem. Grid 960 allows nested grids. Create a subgrid by adding a grid_12 div, then place the grid_4′s inside it. When using nested grids the children elements require special classes. The first child needs a class "alpha" and the last child a class &qout;omega" Edit the markup to reflect the changes and apply stylistic changes to the footer.
